If you can edit or override the system `php.ini` file, increase the memory limit. For example, `memory_limit = 128M`\n\n2.

To check for this, access your server via SFTP or FTP, or a file manager in your hosting account's control panel, and rename the `.htaccess` file. If you can't find a `.htaccess` file, make sure that you have set your SFTP or FTP client to view invisible files.\n\nIf you weren’t able to resolve the issue by either resetting your plugins and theme or renaming your `.htaccess` file, we may be able to help, but we'll need a more detailed error message. Internal server errors are usually described in more detail in the server error log. If you have access to your server error log, generate the error again, note the date and time, then immediately check your server error log for any errors that occurred during that time period. If you don’t have access to your server error log, ask your hosting provider to look for you."
